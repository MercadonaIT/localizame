# Localizame

## What is Localizame?

Localizame is an opinionated open-source tool that generates Android, iOS, and Angular code, ready to be imported into your project, from a .xlsx template of internationalization (i18n) terms.

You can run Localizame locally as a web application using SvelteKit + Vite.

## Live Demo

Check out the fully functional demo of Localizame at [here](https://opensource.mercadona.com/localizame).

(We use a courtesy spot instance on GCP. If the demo is unresponsive, it means it's rebooting for a minute or two ðŸ˜„)

## How it Works

Localizame is designed with a simple workflow. The input is an .xlsx file with a single sheet containing various columns. The first column contains string keys, and the subsequent columns contain translations for different languages, as many as you need.

### Step 1: Load the File

Drag and drop your .xlsx file into the designated area. You can find an example input file [here](./examples/example_input.xlsx).

### Step 2: Generate Code

Select the platforms you want to generate code for and click the "Download" button. You can find an example output file for Android and iOS [here](./examples/example_output.zip).

And **VoilÃ !** The downloaded .zip file contains the code that you need to add to your project to consume the translations.

## How to Run
